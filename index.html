        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, my name is Diana Montes. I am currently enrolled at the University of California, Riverside in pursuit of a Bachelor of Arts in English. I was born and raised in Riverside, which has fostered a deep sense of community in me. I look toward helping my community members thrive because I am a firm believer in community prosperity. Growth and success start at the local level, so I integrate myself into my community and use my resources to provide better opportunities. My greatest passion is education and English. As a daughter of immigrant parents, I know first-hand, how pertinent both aspects are in one's future. Hence, the majority of my free time has been spent helping the youth in my community.<br><br>

      I volunteer at Think Together, a non-profit California-based after-school program in my hometown. The organization works with school districts to provide extended learning programs for underprivileged students living in low-income communities. It has been a privilege to work with this organization. I can help elementary school students have a strong foothold in their education and development. The elementary school I volunteer at is predominately Hispanic and Latino, so often the students I work with are English learners who have no access to tutoring services outside of school. The Think Together Program gives students the resources to engage in rich curriculum and homework assistance. As a volunteer, I assist program leaders in directing student learning activities and facilitating homework time. My goal is to be a positive role model for the students and demonstrate the endless possibilities they have for their future. The more children see people like them in pursuit of education or building skills, the easier it is for them to dream big. It is easy for young people to be trapped inside a box, which I why I explore areas outside my field of education, such as computer programming and public policy. Young students should be open to a world of opportunities and know it is in their hands to become who they want to become. <br><br>

        I have also worked with older students, including Middle School and High School in tutoring and creative projects. These projects include campus cleaning, playground reconstruction, and event collaboration at local churches. It takes planning coordination, leadership, and an inspiring persona to carry out these labors. Despite my introverted demeanor, I have walked out of my comfort zone to attain my tasks and goals. My greatest trait is my ability to learn new skills with little guidance and take on leadership roles. My creativity and passion for learning permit me to find new solutions to obstacles that appear. I am very determined and can achieve anything I put my mind to. I tend to find solutions independently, but am open to collaborating and asking for assistance for the greater good. I am very detail-oriented, which propels me to work diligently and quickly. However, I am also good at seeing the bigger picture and taking calculated risks for the best possible end goal. I am quite empathetic and care deeply for those around me. I have an eloquent balance between completing tasks successfully and carrying the needs of those I am working with or for. I look forward to working with you and becoming a part of your company. Thank you for taking the time to read through my profile. I hope to hear from you soon.
